# Machine-Learning-Projects

**1. Movie Recommendation System**
 
*Project Overview:*
In this project, I have created a movie recommendation system using Jupyter, Python, and Pandas. At the end, users can be able to type the name of a movie into an input box, and instantly get recommendations for other movies that he/she might like.

*Project Steps:*
* Reading in our movie data with pandas
* Cleaning movie titles with regex
* Creating a tfidf matrix
* Creating a search function
* Building an interactive search box with Jupyter
* Reading in movie ratings data
* Finding users who liked the same movie
* Finding how much all users like movies
* Creating a recommendation score
* Building a recommendation function
* Creating an interactive recommendation widget

*To follow this project, please install the following locally:*
* JupyerLab / Jupyter Notebook
* Python 3.8+
* Python packages
* pandas
* scikit-learn

DATA: I have downloaded the data from: https://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-25m.zip 


**2. Stock Price Predictions:**

*Project Overview:*
In this project, I have predict the price of the S&P500 stock market index.

* Downloaded S&P 500 price data
* Cleaning and visualizing our stock market data
* Setting up our target for machine learning
* Training an initial machine learning model
* Building a backtesting system
* Adding additional predictors to our model
* Improving our model

*Project Steps:*
* Downloaded the data using the yfinance package
* Create an initial machine learning model and estimate accuracy
* Build a backtesting engine to more accurately measure accuracy
* Improve the accuracy of the model. 


*To follow this project, please install the following locally:*
* JupyerLab / Jupyter Notebook
* Python 3.8+
* Python packages
* pandas
* yfinance
* scikit-learn

*DATA: I have downloaded all of the data during the project, using the yfinance package.*
